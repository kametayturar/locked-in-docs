This Privacy Policy describes how "Locked In - Productivity Dashboard" ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our Chrome Extension.

### Information We Access

To provide its core functionality, our extension requires access to your Google Calendar data. We request your permission through Google's standard OAuth consent screen for the following scope:

**We do not store, save, copy, or transmit your calendar data to any external servers or third parties.** All data processing happens locally on your computer. The information is fetched from Google's servers and displayed to you. It is discarded when you close the tab.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information or calendar data with anyone.
