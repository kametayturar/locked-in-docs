## Google Calendar Integration

To help you stay on top of your schedule, Locked In can display your upcoming events for the day directly on your dashboard. This feature requires you to grant permission to access your Google Calendar.

*   **Permission Requested:** `View events on all your calendars` (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`).
*   **How it Works:** The extension uses this permission to read event details (like time and title) from your calendars for the current day.
*   **Your Privacy is Paramount:** Your calendar information is **never** stored, copied, or transmitted to any server. All data processing happens locally on your computer. The information is only used to display your schedule to you.
