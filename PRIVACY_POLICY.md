# Privacy Policy for Locked In - Productivity Dashboard

**Last Updated:** August 1, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the "Locked In - Productivity Dashboard" Chrome Extension (the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

## Information We Access

To provide its core functionality, the Service requires access to certain information.

### Google Calendar Data

A central feature of the Service is a widget that displays your upcoming Google Calendar events for the day. To enable this feature, we must request your permission to access your Google Calendar data.

*   **Google OAuth Scope Requested:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
*   **Permission Description:** This permission allows the extension to **view** events on your calendars. It does **not** grant the ability to edit, create, or delete events.

## How We Use Your Information

The information accessed from your Google Calendar is used exclusively to provide features within the extension on your local device.

*   **Display of Events:** Your calendar data (event titles, times, and dates) is used solely to display your upcoming events for the day on the dashboard.
*   **Local Processing:** All processing of your calendar data happens locally within your Chrome browser on your computer.
*   **No Data Storage or Transmission:** Your calendar information is **never** stored, saved, copied, or transmitted to our servers or any third-party service. The data is fetched from Google's servers and displayed directly to you. It is not retained after you close the tab.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not collect any personal information, and therefore, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties for their commercial purposes. Since we never store your calendar data, there is nothing for us to share or disclose.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
